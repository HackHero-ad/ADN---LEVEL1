# Rocket Engine Performance Predictor 🚀

### 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **Level 1 Milestone** for the "Aerospace AI/ML Roadmap." The goal was to build a Machine Learning model capable of predicting the **Specific Impulse (Isp)** of a liquid rocket engine based on its design parameters.

By analyzing historical engine data, this model allows for rapid performance estimation during the preliminary design phase of propulsion systems.

### 📂 Dataset
* **Source:** [Astronautix Engine Database](http://www.astronautix.com/d/datadownloads.html)
* **Size:** ~1,200 Engines (Filtered for Liquid Propellant)
* **Key Features:**
    * `Thrust (Vacuum)`: The force generated by the engine.
    * `Chamber Pressure`: Internal pressure during combustion.
    * `Propellants`: Chemical composition (e.g., Lox/Kerosene, Lox/LH2).
* **Target Variable:** `Isp (Vacuum)` - A measure of fuel efficiency.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.8+
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Model:** Random Forest Regressor (vs. Linear Regression Baseline)

### 📊 Results
The model was evaluated using R-Squared ($R^2$) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
* **Linear Regression $R^2$:** ~0.65 (Baseline)
* **Random Forest $R^2$:** **~0.85 - 0.92** (Final Model)

The Random Forest model significantly outperformed the baseline, successfully capturing the non-linear relationships between chamber pressure, scale, and engine efficiency.
