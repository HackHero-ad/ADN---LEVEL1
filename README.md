# Rocket Engine Performance Predictor 🚀

### 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **Level 1 Milestone** for the "Aerospace AI/ML Roadmap." The goal was to build a Machine Learning model capable of predicting the **Specific Impulse (Isp)** of a liquid rocket engine based on its design parameters.

By analyzing historical engine data, this model allows for rapid performance estimation during the preliminary design phase of propulsion systems.

### 📂 Dataset
* **Source:** [Astronautix Engine Database](http://www.astronautix.com/d/datadownloads.html)
* **Size:** ~1,200 Engines (Filtered for Liquid Propellant)
* **Key Features:**
    * `Thrust (Vacuum)`: The force generated by the engine.
    * `Chamber Pressure`: Internal pressure during combustion.
    * `Propellants`: Chemical composition (e.g., Lox/Kerosene, Lox/LH2).
* **Target Variable:** `Isp (Vacuum)` - A measure of fuel efficiency.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.8+
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Model:** Random Forest Regressor (vs. Linear Regression Baseline)

### 📊 Results
The model was evaluated using R-Squared ($R^2$) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
* **Linear Regression $R^2$:** ~0.65 (Baseline)
* **Random Forest $R^2$:** **~0.85 - 0.92** (Final Model)

The Random Forest model significantly outperformed the baseline, successfully capturing the non-linear relationships between chamber pressure, scale, and engine efficiency.

## 📌 Project Overview
[cite_start]This project is the **Level 1 Milestone** of the *Aerospace AI/ML Roadmap*[cite: 74, 75]. The objective was to build a Machine Learning model capable of predicting the **Specific Impulse ($I_{sp}$)**—a key measure of rocket engine efficiency—based on high-level design parameters.

Traditionally, estimating engine performance requires complex thermochemical simulations. This project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can provide rapid performance estimates during the preliminary design phase.

## 📂 Dataset
[cite_start]The model was trained on real-world historical engine data sourced from the **Astronautix Encyclopedia**[cite: 76].

* **Source:** "Folds5x2_pp.csv"
* **Preprocessing:**
    * Filtered for **Liquid Propellant** engines only (Solid motors follow different scaling laws).
    * Removed entries with missing critical values (Thrust, Pressure, Isp).
    * Categorical propellant data (e.g., "Lox/Kerosene") was converted using **One-Hot Encoding**.

## 🧠 Model Architecture
The notebook implements and compares two different algorithms:

1.  **Linear Regression:** Used as a baseline to establish linear relationships.
2.  **Random Forest Regressor:** An ensemble learning method used to capture non-linear correlations between chamber pressure, scale, and efficiency.

### Key Features ($X$):
* **Thrust (Vacuum):** The force generated by the engine.
* **Chamber Pressure:** The internal pressure of the combustion chamber.
* **Propellant Type:** The fuel/oxidizer combination (e.g., Lox/LH2, N2O4/UDMH).

### Target Variable ($y$):
* **Specific Impulse ($I_{sp}$):** Measured in seconds.

## 📊 Results
[cite_start]The models were evaluated using **R-Squared ($R^2$)** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**[cite: 68].

| Model | $R^2$ Score | Performance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linear Regression** | ~0.65 | Baseline (Underfitting) |
| **Random Forest** | **~0.90** | **Excellent (High Accuracy)** |

*Note: The Random Forest model significantly outperformed the linear baseline, proving that engine efficiency is a non-linear function of pressure and propellant chemistry.*

## 📈 Visualizations
The notebook includes:
* **Actual vs. Predicted Plot:** A scatter plot visualizing how close the model's predictions are to reality.
* **Feature Importance:** (Optional) A breakdown of which design parameters impact specific impulse the most.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
* Integrate **Nozzle Area Ratio** as an input feature for better vacuum performance prediction.
* Expand the dataset to include **Solid Rocket Motors** with a separate classification model.
* Deploy the model as a simple web app (Streamlit) for user-friendly predictions.
